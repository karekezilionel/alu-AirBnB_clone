### Airbnb Clone

#### Description
This stage of the AirBnB Clone covers the HTML and CSS implementation.

The Images folder contains the visual assets used across the project, such as the site logo and icons for features like bathrooms, bedrooms, and guests.

The Styles folder contains the CSS files responsible for page design and layout. Within each category (common, footer, header, places), the file with the largest version number shows the most complete and refined styling.

The index.html files are numbered to reflect progress, with the highest-numbered file representing the most finalized version of the interface for this phase.
